# Housing-market-in-Canada
This is an exploration of Housing market in Canada.

At the starting point, I just focus on the houses in Nova Scotia because I have lived here for six years.

Data is collected from Point2homes.ca and store in the CSV file called 'Point2_data.csv'

Dataframe includes seven columns which are number of bedrooms, number of bath, square feets of the house, price, address, latitude, and longitude

After the data is cleaned, I found that there are 230 locations which couldn't get coordinates on Google map.
